      "But the 5 is in the TENS place! It means 5 tens, which is 50!",

      "8 needs 2 more to make 10. So take 2 from the 7!",

      "So 10 + 5 = 15! That's your answer!",

      "For bigger numbers like 23 + 15, break them into tens and ones!",
      "23 = 20 + 3, and 15 = 10 + 5!",

      "Put them together: 30 + 8 = 38!",
