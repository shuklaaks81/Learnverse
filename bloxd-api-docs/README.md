# Code API

You can run javascript when right clicking code blocks and press to code boards.
This is only available to owners of worlds lobbies.
The javascript can interact with the Bloxd.io game api.

Please use [our discord](https://discord.gg/playbloxd) to report any issues you come across or features you'd like to see added.

## Code Blocks

- World owners can find these by searching in the creative menu
- No need to add `press to code`, this text is only needed for code boards, and will automatically be removed
- If you want to run code without opening the code editor, you can trigger the code block by right clicking an adjacent `press to code` board instead

## Boards

- You can begin a board with `press to code` to run javascript when you right click it.
- Normally you can't edit a code board after placing it, but you can currently work around this by putting a space before `press to code`.
- Boards only allow for a small amount of text, we recommend you use Code Blocks instead, or you can work around this by using multiple boards

## Notes

- Global variables `myId` and `playerId` store the player ID of who is running the code.
- Global variable `thisPos` stores the position of the currently executing code block or press to code board.
- `myId`, `playerId`, `thisPos` and `ownerDbId` are all defined on `api`
- You can use `api.log` or `console.log` for printing and debugging (they do the same thing).
- You can use `Date.now()` instead of `api.now()` if you prefer, both return the time in milliseconds.
- Comments like `/* comment */` work, but comments like `// comment` don't work right now.

## Examples

Code Block to make the player jump:

```js
f = api.setVelocity(myId, 0, 9, 0)
```

Push the player:

```js
api.applyImpulse(myId, 9, 0, 9)
```

Send an orange message to yourself:

```js
api.sendMessage(myId, "text", { color: "orange" })
```

Create flying text:

```js
const speed = 100
api.sendFlyingMiddleMessage(myId, ["Message to display"], speed)
```

Send a message to all players:

```js
api.broadcastMessage("announcement", { color: "red" })
```

Set player health to 99, and print the old health:

```js
const oldHealth = api.getHealth(myId)
api.setHealth(myId, 99)
api.log("Old Health:", oldHealth)
```

Define a function to get the player IDs excluding your own ID:

```js
getOtherIds = () => {
    const ids = api.getPlayerIds()
    const otherIds = []
    for (const id of ids) {
        if (id !== myId) {
            otherIds.push(id)
        }
    }
    return otherIds
}
```

Use the function above to make other players look like zombies:

```js
for (const otherId of getOtherIds()) {
    api.setPlayerPose(otherId, "zombie")
    api.changePlayerIntoSkin(otherId, "head", "zombie")
}
```

Make all players look like floating wizards:

```js
for (const playerId of api.getPlayerIds()) {
    api.setPlayerPose(playerId, "driving")
    api.changePlayerIntoSkin(playerId, "head", "wizard")
}
```

/**
 * ANIMATION SCHEMA TYPES
 *
 * An animation schema describes how an entity should be positioned as time passes.
 * For each node in the entity's skeleton, we define an animation timeline.
 * A timeline is sequence of "key frames".
 * A keyframe represents an important position; if this is a jumping animation,
 * then an example of a keyframe would be the peak of the jump.
 *
 * When deciding how an entity should be positioned during an animation,
 * we will usually find ourselves between two keyframes.
 * For example, if our keyframes are at time fractions 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0,
 * and the current time fraction is 0.3, then we will need to find a middle ground
 * between the first and second keyframe.
 * This process is known as interpolating, or "lerping".
 * The default way of doing this is linear lerping; drawing a straight line between two points.
 * An alternative is splining; drawing a curve.
