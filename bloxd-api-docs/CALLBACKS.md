# Callbacks

Players can use World Code in custom worlds get functions they've written to run when game events happen. These special functions are called callbacks. The world code can be viewed by pressing F8 by default. Initially the world code will have this comment, which can be removed:

```text
tick onClose onPlayerJoin onPlayerLeave onPlayerJump onRespawnRequest
playerCommand onPlayerChat onPlayerChangeBlock onPlayerDropItem
onPlayerPickedUpItem onPlayerSelectInventorySlot onBlockStand
onPlayerAttemptCraft onPlayerCraft onPlayerAttemptOpenChest

onPlayerThrowableHitTerrain onTouchscreenActionButton onTaskClaimed
onChunkLoaded onPlayerRequestChunk onItemDropCreated
onPlayerStartChargingItem onPlayerFinishChargingItem onPlayerFinishQTE
onPlayerToggledShopMenu onPlayerBoughtShopItem doPeriodicSave

To use a callback, just assign a function to it in the world code!
tick = () => {}			 or			 function tick() {}
```

You can use `api.setCallbackValueFallback("callbackName", defaultValue)` to set a default value to be returned by your callback code if it throws an error.

## doPeriodicSave
Called every so often.

You should save custom db values/s3 objects here.

Persisted items ARE saved on graceful shutdown (e.g. uncaught error, update, etc),

but this helps prevent large data-loss on non-graceful shutdowns.
